# Week 3: Milestone

This week, I explored some options with Qiskit. Qiskit is an open-source framework for computing created by IBM.  Qiskit is based on Python which provides a familiar foundation. Quantum circuit model will be what my code is based on. It is composed of qubits, unitary gates, and measurements. 

During the past couple weeks, I mainly focused on literature reviews to find potential Quantum learning models and I have found several. In the next couple weeks, I will get familiar with Qiskit and quantum circuits for subroutines.

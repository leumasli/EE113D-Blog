# Week 9 Updates

Last week, I successfully constructed a functional hybrid quantum network with 2 qubits and trained it on a digital image recognition dataset. The goal for this week is to either increase the size of the quantum neural network or to send the network to IBM quantum service and train it on a actual quantum computer. Unfortunately, I was not able to train the QNN on the quantum computer because of two reasons. First, the actual quantum classical computation so if I can theoretically only run a pure quantum network on them, which doesn't have much practical use because of the very limited qubit size. I did try to break down the network and calculate the classical parts on my local machine and send the quantum layer to the quantum computer, but that did not work for some unknown reasons, possibly because the coherence time on the quantum computer is not long enough to support the calculation. Another main reason that prevented the training was the long queue time. Each job sent to the IBM machine usually stays in the queue for a day.

Fortunately, qiskit provides a good simulation toolset and allows quantum simulation on classical computers with only few modification of the training loop. The simulation also allowed bigger model size. In the end, I used a bigger model than last week and achieved 99% testing accuracy on binary classification of handwritten digits.

It seems that given the poor performance of actual quantum computers, simulation remains the way to go. Next week, I'll try to optimize the model and train it on a bigger dataset, potentially with a larger size QNN as well.

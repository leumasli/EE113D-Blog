# Week 3: Milestone

In the past week, I have been focusing on implementing tool models on Qiskit. Qiskit is an open-souse python package developed by IBM for quantum computing. I have implemented several toy models such as Quantum Phase Estimation and Shor's algorithm on a small dataset to demosntarted the possibility to use Qiskit as the main development package. So far the main difficulty I encountered has to do with the fact that Qiskit is a low level language and it operates the network on a circuit level. Which means the first thing I need to address in developing a large network is to implement methods to automatically generate codes for subroutines. 

## Milestone update

The goal for my the first milestone is to obtain a general understanding for the current landscape of quantum neural network and choose a direction for the actual model. I have mostly achieved this goal. My work in the first two weeks was focused on literature review and I have gained a fair bit of knowledge for quantum neural network implementations. I have also chose to develop a hybird model with quantum-classical map as a main direction for the network.

The next step for this project is to start focusing on subroutines for neural networks and start implementing actual code for quantum circuits. I did shifted my work a bit this week to focus on actual development language instead of literature review, which is planned to be done during a later stage, so I expect to spend some extra time on literatrue reviews.
